Mobile devices App development
-------------------------------

* Programming is easy, but software engineering is hard. [@Hunt2000]
* Developing apps is multidisciplinary [@Martin2008]
  * Write code.
  * Develop or use third-party APIs.
  * Design and scalable and maintainable architecture.
  * Creative and Usable design.

Warm-Up (1)
-----------

* Care about your craft: Why spend your life developing code unless you care about doing well?
* Don't live with broken windows. Fix bad designs, wrong decisions or poor code asap.
* DRY. Do not repeat your self.
* Make it easy to reuse
* Don't think outside the box - Find the box: We faced with an impossible problem, identify real constrains. Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?

* Don't be afraid to say "I don't know"
.. but follow it up with:
"I'll find out"
* Work with a user to think like a user.
* Test early, test often, test automatically.
* Estimate the order of your algorithms.
* Write code that writes code.

Mobile Platforms
==================

Mobile Platforms (1)
-----------------

* What mobile platforms do you know?
* What is your experience?

Mobile Platforms (2)
-----------------

* Native tools:
  * Android
  * iOs
* Cross-platform tools:
  * PhoneGap
  * React Native
  * Xamarin
  * Flutter
  * Kotlin Native

Native vs Cross-Platform (1)
----------------------------

* Native tools:
  * Allows users to learn quickly.
  * Easy to discover (Play Store or Apple Store).
  * Easy to use the device hardware.
  * High Performance and Great UX.
* Cross-Platform tools:
  * Portability.
  * Faster development.
  * Cheaper.
  * Easy to support and maintain.

Native vs Cross-Platform (2)
----------------------------

What is the best option? **It depends**. Everyone needs to choose the one that suits their needs in a better way.

Consider:

* One or multiple platforms
* Cost
* Technology

Android
--------

* Advantages
  * Kotlin as a programming language.
  * Mature architecture.
  * ConstraintLayout 2.0.
  * Google is behind
* Disadvantages
  * Fragmentation
  * Android X
* Tools
  * Android Studio, IntelliJ Idea, Visual...
  * Emulators available on all platforms

iOS
--------

* Advantages
  * Swift as a programming language.
  * Swift is open source.
  * Fast adoption of latest OS.
* Disadvantages
  * Cost
  * You need a mac to develop.
  * Strict App review.
* Tools
  * Xcode, AppCode

React Native
------------

* Backed by Facebook.
* Used by Instagram Facebook, Airbnb, Walmart, Tesla...
* React library and JavaScript to deliver a native experience on iOS and Android
* Fast development.

Ionic
------

* Makes the best use of web tech HTML, CSS, javascript.
* Cordova to wrap the apps in native containers.
* Built on Angular.
* Strong community support.
* Highly interactive apps.
* Easy learning curve.

Flutter
--------

* Backed by Google.
* Used by Alibaba, Hamilton Musical, Google Ads,...
* High performance.
* Dart is a modern, multi-paradigm and objected-oriented programming for building web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps.
  
API Frameworks
================

Most common (API Frameworks)
----------------------------

* Spring
* Django
* Flask
* Falcon
* Express (NodeJS)
* Ruby on Rails

Objectives
-----------

* Understand the Android platform and the elements that make it up.
* Understand and use coding patterns.
* Develop applications for the Android operating system.
* Establish the bases for implementing additional functionalities (access to the database, access to resources and features of the mobile, etc.).
* Develop and use API as a backend.
* Get to know the step of publishing Android applications.

Evaluation
-------------

You must pass both exams with a minimum mark of 5 to pass the course.

* **First Exam (P1)**: *15%* Live coding exam.
* **First Exam (P2)**: *15%* Live coding exam.
  
* **Project**: Development of your own app. **50%**.
  * **Milestone 1 (M1)**: *12%*.
  * **Milestone 2 (M2)**: *14%*.
  * **Milestone 3 (M3)**: *24%*.
* **Common Part**: *20%*. (Projecte Integrador)

Code Evaluation

Methodology
-----------

* Students must perform the proposed **HandsOn** in the field before the sessions. The live sessions will serve to agree on doubts and expand the concepts worked on in the **HandsOn** (1h).
* Practical sessions will be focused on realizing the implementation of the project.  However, a few sessions will be aimed to perform some workshops during the season of live coding (2h).
* Open Source and pragmatic methodology, all your development must be public in Github.
* Functional deliveries, with constant feedback and suggestions allow students to pivoting  and make corrections.

Project using DevOps
---------------------

* GitFlow:
  * Develop branch: All development until next release.
  * Master branch: Most recent release.
  * Features: Develop isolate feature and merge/rebase then in the develop branch.
  * **HandsOn 01**: [Digging into Git](https://cv.udl.cat/portal/directtool/e5931457-d3b2-4ca0-8ffe-7405d6f56124/)
* Project Management (Agile and Scrum):
  * Project definition and planning
  * Project launch and execution
  * Performance and control
  * Project close
* Docker:
  * Containerizing the applications to support the development and quick releases.


What languages you should learn?
-----------------------------

* **Mandatory**:
  * *Android Programming*:
    * JAVA
    * KOTLIN
  * *Backend Programming*:
    * Python (Falcon)

* **Optional** (depending time, availability and your motivation):
  * *Cross-Platform Programming*:
    * Flutter
  * *Game development*:
    * Unity
  
Java
-----

* Advantages:
  * Easy to learn, understand, and flexible.
  * A good choice for cross-platform apps.
  * Java has an extensive open-source ecosystem.
  * More compact and light apps.
  * Fast build compared with Kotlin.
* Disadvantages:
  * Limitations that causes problems in android design.
  * You need to write more.
  * Requires a lot of memory

Kotlin
------

* Advantages:
  * Easy to switch from Java.
  * Smart extensions to build.
  * More concise.
  * Compatible with all Java libraries, frameworks, and JVM.
